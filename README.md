# Node-Basics
Use of **async, rsvp, rxjs** with node to get the title of any website.<br /><br />

Before running the tasks, **'npm install'** command must be run on command line
so as to resolve all the dependencies.<br /><br />

Once the dependencies are resolved, run each of the files named as <br />
1. caremerge1.js<br />
2. caremerge2.js<br />
3. caremerge3.js<br />
4. bonus.js<br /><br />

with **'node' then a space 'filename'** which will start the server on 
**"localhost:8080"**.<br /><br />

For each of the questions please hit url e.g<br /><br />

localhost:8080/I/want/title/?address=www.google.com.pk&address=www.yahoo.com; <br />
localhost:8080/I/want/title/?address=www.google.com.pk<br />
